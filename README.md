### ℹ️ Description

This repository contains Java classes for handling geometric shapes, including `Line`, `Point`, and `PolyLine`. These classes provide functionalities to perform calculations and operations on lines and polylines.

### 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and libraries are installed.

### 📂 Project Structure

The project has the following package structure:

- `shapes.model`: Contains the main Java classes for shapes handling.
  - `Line.java`: Represents a line segment between two points.
  - `Point.java`: Represents a point in a 2D coordinate system.
  - `PolyLine.java`: Represents a polyline composed of multiple line segments.
- `Test.java`: Contains sample test cases to demonstrate the usage of the classes.

### 🧪 Running the Tests

To run the sample test cases:

1. Open the `Test.java` file in your Java IDE.
2. Execute the `main` method in the `Test` class.

The output will be displayed in the console, showing the results of the test cases.

### 📄 Examples and Usage

The `Test.java` file contains several examples and usage scenarios for the shape classes. Each example demonstrates the creation of points, lines, and polylines, as well as performing operations like calculating distances and lengths.

Feel free to modify the examples or create your own to explore the capabilities of the shape classes.

### 📚 Documentation

Each class in the `shapes.model` package is thoroughly documented using Javadoc comments. Refer to the code documentation to understand the purpose, parameters, and return values of each method.
